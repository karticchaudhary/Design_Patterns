# This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.
This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

# Singleton Pattern ensures that one and only one Object is instantiated for a given class. Whenever an object of a given class is required,
only single(No more than one object) Object get returned.

# Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".
In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.
