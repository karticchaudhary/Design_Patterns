# Abstract factory pattern is yet another creational design pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern

# In the Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class.
Then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class.

# Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related
(or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.
That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes.
So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.
