# From the basic book of Design Patters (written by the so Called Gang of Four or GoF):
“Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.”

# The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input,
we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the
client program to the factory class.

# Factory pattern introduces loose coupling between classes which is the most important principle one should consider
and apply while designing the application architecture.
