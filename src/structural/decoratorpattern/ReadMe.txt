# Decorator design pattern is used to add additional features or behaviors to a particular instance of a class,
while not modifying the other instances of same class.

# Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality.
Please note that the description above implies that decorating an object changes its behavior but not its interface.

# A Decorator Pattern says that just "attach a flexible additional responsibilities to an object dynamically".
