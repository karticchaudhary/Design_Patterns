# Composite design pattern is a structural pattern which modifies the structure of an object.
This pattern is most suitable in cases where you need to work with objects which form a tree like hierarchy.
In that tree, each node/object (except root node) is either composite or leaf node. Implementing the composite pattern
lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

# A Composite Pattern says that just "allow clients to operate in generic manner on objects that
may or may not represent a hierarchy of objects".

# Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object.
Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.
